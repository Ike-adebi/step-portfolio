      <p> Hello! My name is Daniel Adebi and this is my STEP portfolio. I am a member of 
          MIT's class of 2022, and I am a double major in computer science and physics.
          I grew up in South Jersey, but I currently live in Wilmington, Delaware. In my 
          free time, I like working out and playing sports like basketball and football. 
          I also like watching youtube videos about physics, computer science, and math, 
          along with just gaming and meme videos as well.
