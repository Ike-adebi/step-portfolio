      <p> Hello! My name is Daniel Adebi and this is my STEP portfolio. I am a member of 
        MIT's class of 2022, and I am a double major in computer science and physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up in South Jersey, but I currently live in Wilmington, Delaware. 
        In my free time, I like to work out and play sports like basketball and football. 
        I also like watching youtube videos if I'm just really bored.
      </p>
      <p> 
        I first got interested in coding when I was around 12 years old,
        and my interest really stemmed from playing video games. From there,
        I started to try and learn how some of my favorite games were made, so
        I began looking up tutorials about how to make games on youtube. And from
        this point forward, my interest really grew, and I've created various projects
        including video games, machine learning models, and educational applications.
